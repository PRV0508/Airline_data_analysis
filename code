Code of the project : airlines data analysis 

1) first step is to upload the data to the hdfs. This command use to put data from local file system to hdfs.

Command : hdfs dfs -put /home/prateek/Downloads/flight-delays/flights.csv /home

2) then we create table for storing the dataset.table has 31 colomns. Table is going to handle to million row of data.

Command : 

CREATE TABLE Flights(day_of_year int, origin String, dest String,scheduled_depart Float,depart_delay double, schedul_time Float, distance int,schedule_arrival Float, arrival_delay double, diverted int, cancelled int,dow2 int,dow3 int,dow4 int,dow5 int, dow6 int,dow7 int,airline_as int,airline_b6 int,airline_dl int,airline_ev int,airline_f9 int,airline_ha int,airline_mq int,airline_nk int,airline_oo int,airline_ua int,airline_us int,airline_vx int,airline_wn int,aircraft_late int,bad_wheather int,security int,arrival_delay_bn int) 
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' ;

3) we can check schema of out table by using the commaned : DESCRIBE Flights ; 

4) Now we need to import datafile flight.csv which is stored in hdfs into table that we have just created.

command: LOAD DATA INPATH 'hdfs:/home/flights.csv' INTO TABLE Flights;

Problem statement 1 :
show the 5 day of the year on which maximum flights get cancelled due to bad weather : 
commands :  

select day_of_year,COUNT(cancelled) as t FROM Flights
WHERE cancelled = 1 AND bad_wheather=1
GROUP BY day_of_year
ORDER BY DESC
LIMIT 5;

Problem statement 2:
Top 10 routes that have seen maximum number of diversions 
commands : 

select origin,dest,COUNT(diverted) as t FROM Flights
WHERE diverted=1
GROUP BY origin,dest
ORDER BY t DESC
LIMIT 10;


Problem statement 3:
Top 5 visited destination
command : 

select dest,COUNT(dest) as x FROM Flights
GROUP BY dest
ORDER BY x DESC
LIMIT 5;


Problem statement 4:
Top 10 maximum distance flights that get cancelled due to bad weather : 
command : 

select origin,dest,MAX(distance) as q FROM Flights
WHERE cancelled=1 AND bad_wheather=1
GROUP BY origin, dest
ORDER BY q DESC
LIMIT 10;

Problem statement 5 : 
Top 10 maximum distance flights can get cancelled due to security reasons : 
commands : 

select origin,dest,MAX(distance) as q FROM Flights
WHERE cancelled=1 AND security=1
GROUP BY origin, dest
ORDER BY q DESC
LIMIT 10;
